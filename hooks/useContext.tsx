/**
 * useContext lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.
 *
 * Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that contex.
 * The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the calling component in the tree.
 *
 * When the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest context value passed to that MyContext provider.
 * Even if an ancestor uses React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using useContext.
 *
 * [Rendering]
 * A component calling useContext will always re-render when the context value changes.
 * If re-rendering the component is expensive, you can optimize it by using memoization.
