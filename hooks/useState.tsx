/**
 * React will preserve this state between re-renders.
 * useState returns a pair of values: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState()
 * The only argument to useState is the initial state. In the example below, it is 0 because our counter starts from zero. It could be an object too.
 * The initial state argument is only used during the first render.
 * If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.
 *
 * [Rendering]
 * The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.
 * If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects. (React uses the Object.is comparison algorithm.)
 * If youâ€™re doing expensive calculations while rendering, you can optimize them with useMemo.
