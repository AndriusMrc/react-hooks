/**
 * Pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies.
 * useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if at least one of the dependencies has changed.
 * This is useful when passing callbacks to child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.
 * Every value referenced inside the callback should also appear in the dependencies array.
 *
 * [callback vs useMemo]
 * useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps).
 * callback returns function that can be called while useMemo returns value of the function. So if you need to pass parameters, use callback.
