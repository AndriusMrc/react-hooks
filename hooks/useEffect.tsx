/**
 * Data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components operations are called “side effects”
 * (or “effects” for short) because they can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering.
 *
 * The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects in function components.
 * When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM.
 *
 * Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state.
 * By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render.
 * You can use more than a single effect in a component.
 * React will apply every effect used by the component, in the order they were specified.
 *
 * [Two kinds of side effects]
 * There are two common kinds of side effects in React components: those that don’t require cleanup, and those that do.
 * If useEffect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up
 * When exactly does React clean up an effect? React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.
 * The clean-up function runs before the component is removed from the UI to prevent memory leaks.
 * Effects run for every render and not just once. This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.
 *
 * [Optimizing performance by skipping effects]
 * In some cases, cleaning up or applying the effect after every render might create a performance problem.
 * You can tell React to skip applying an effect if certain values haven’t changed between re-renders. To do so, pass an array as an optional second argument to useEffect
 *
 * [Run only once]
 * If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]).
 * This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.
 * If you pass an empty array ([]), the props and state inside the effect will always have their initial values.
 *
 * [Tips]
 * Use Multiple Effects to Separate Concerns.
